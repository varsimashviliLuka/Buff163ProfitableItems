# Buff163ProfitableItems
Find profitable CS2 items on Buff163 and show them on localhost server.

For this program to work, you have to put your Buff163 cookies in config.txt file.
In config.txt you will also find "minPrice", "maxPrice" and "allowedPercent".

minPrice and maxPrice is the range to find items. you can change that amount.
allowedPercent is to find only items that is more likely to leave that amount of percent profit. for example 0.1 is 10%, 0.25 is 25% etc.

If you are on Windows you just simply open setup.bat file to install required libraries, or just install them from CMD/Terminal
Required libraries are: "flask" and "requests"

after everything is done, simply execute main python file, on Windows open start.bat, or just execute it from CMD/Terminal.

Please if you are able to make better Css design, contact me! :)

Enjoy!
