In config.txt you will also find "minPrice", "maxPrice" and "allowedPercent".

minPrice and maxPrice is the range to find items. you can change that amount.
allowedPercent is to find only items that is more likely to leave that amount of percent profit. for example 0.1 is 10%, 0.25 is 25% etc.

After everything is ready, simply execute main python file, on Windows open start.bat, or just execute it from CMD/Terminal.
